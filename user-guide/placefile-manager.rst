Placefile Manager
=============

The placefile manager can be accessed from the menu by selecting **Tools > Placefile Manager**. Placefiles give the user flexibility when deciding to add additional features not included by default. 

After opening the placefile manager, the user is presented with the ability to add, remove or refresh placefiles.

Adding a placefile

To add a placefile, the user will need to hit the Add button, and then the user is given the option to add a link to a specific placefile that is hosted online or add a locally made placefile using the button that has 3 dots.

Thresholds
^^^^^^^^^^

Thresholds give the user the ability to hide placefiles when at a zoom level which is set by the placefile. 

.. note:: This is fully dependant upon the placefile itself, and cannot be changed by the user.

To enable a threshold, the user will check the box next to the placefile under the T column. The user may also sort by all enabled thresholds in the list by clicking the T.

Filter
^^^^^^

The user may filter the list of placefiles. The user can filter the list by the name of the placefile or by the link of the placefile. One reason a user may want to do this is if the user's placefile list becomes too big to search through and they're looking to search for specific placefiles.
