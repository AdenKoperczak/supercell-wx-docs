Supercell Wx
============

Supercell Wx is a free, open source application to visualize live and archive
NEXRAD Level 2 and Level 3 data, and severe weather alerts. It displays
continuously updating weather data on top of a responsive map, providing the
capability to monitor weather events using reflectivity, velocity, and other
products.

Future versions of the application will bring features such as weather reports,
lightning data, placefile support, and much more. See the development roadmap
for details.
